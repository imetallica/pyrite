# Pyrite Emulator

> Scalable MMORPG Game Server

## Welcome to Pyrite (Rebooted)

An modern, alternative to well known emulators, written in the Elixir Programming Language, that runs on the Erlang virtual machine, known for its scalability, fault tolerance and low latency.

## Project Goals

- Beam it for the greater good: To showcase the capabilities of the Erlang Virtual Machine - the BEAM.
- Correctness: Emulate the behaviour of the system as close as possible to the original.
- Collaboration: A friendly and open project, where everyone is more than welcome to contribute.
- Freedom: All work is released under the GPL, so everyone is free to use and contribute.
- Fun: To enjoy coding a solution for a challenging project.
- Safe: As a open source project, it must be a safe space for **every single person**.
